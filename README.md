**Fibonacci Series Program (C#)**


This C# console application displays the first n numbers of the Fibonacci series.

The Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1.

Each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

The user is prompted to enter the number n (how many numbers to display).

The program prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci series on the console.



The program starts in the Main method.

The user is asked to enter a number n.

Two variables (a and b) store the first two numbers of the series.

A for loop runs n times:

Print the current number (a).

Calculate the next number as the sum of a and b.

Shift the values so a = b and b = next.

After the loop, the complete series is printed.
